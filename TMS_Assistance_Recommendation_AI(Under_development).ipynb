            "Indian higher education is radical in terms of accessibility, and needs radical reforms in standards, giving value, and pacing. A focus on enforcing both streamlining and holding higher standards of curriculum with the help of international academic publishers for transparency and reducing inequalities characterised by globalisation;[21] making the vocational and doctoral education pipeline value-oriented and innovative; personalisation of the sector for students to gain immediate and valid transferable credentials in their own pace (e.g., Massive open online course, digital learning,[22] etc.); empowering students to seamlessly transition in and out of both education and the workforce as needed while providing continuous learning experience blocks at each stages of education opportunities for equipping the individuals with essential knowledge building blocks for comprehensive understanding of the skill providing courses; establishing a robust institutional accountability in service delivery and addressing related complexities; collaborating with international standardization agencies to ensure that students receive global recognition for their educational certificates, for guaranteeing employers that the educational content aligns with what esteemed universities worldwide employ, etc. are fundamental changes that are critical in attaining both international and national competency.[23] The rise of interest in the IT sector and engineering education in India has confined students to cramming knowledge, providing them with fewer opportunities to explore and develop their passions with modern educational elements like cooperative education and work-based training. Furthermore, by the end of the four-year degree, much of what students study in the initial years becomes irrelevant or subject to knowledge erosion. Many foreign countries view the traditional degree pathway, which compels students of working age to halt their careers for half a decade to earn a degree in a digitized academic environment, as less effective and unsuitable for a growing economy.[24] Especially in a world where 40% of the global population was connected to the Internet in 2015 through 25 billion devices, and where in STEM fields, \"micro-certificates\" are a required aspect of lifelong learning to stay relevant; many of these micro-certificates or learning blocks either function as a start of a base of knowledge or add on to an existing base. For example, most programming courses only take 3 months to learn in an academic setting and that too along with other subjects, and are the only requirement of base knowledge for springboard programming related tech jobs. Jim Heckman, a Nobel laureate and professor of economics at the University of Chicago, asserts that education should be encapsulated by the \"6Cs\" - critical thinking, content communication, collaboration, creativity, character, and citizenship. To broaden students' worldviews and instill values such as creativity, character, and citizenship, India needs to focus on introducing elective pathways to liberal arts education. This will facilitate the development of personal management skills, passions, creativity, and foster natural and concerted personal growth.[25]\n",

            "India is believed to have had a system of higher education as early as 1000 B.C.[26] Unlike present day universities, these ancient learning centers were primarily concerned with dispersing Vedic education.[27] The modern Indian education system finds its roots in colonial legacy.[28] British colonists used the university system as a tool of cultural colonization.[26] Colonial efforts in higher education were carried out initially through the East India Company, followed by the British parliament and later under direct British rule.[27] The first institution of higher learning set up by the British East India Company was the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781. This was followed by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784, Benaras Sanskrit College in 1791 and Fort William College in 1800.[28][27] With the Charter Act of 1813, the British Parliament officially declared Indian education as one of the duties of the state.[28] The same act also removed restrictions on missionary work in British India, thus leading to the establishment of the evangelist Serampore College in 1818.[27] Thomas Babbington Macaulay's famously controversial Minute on Education (1835) reflected the growing support of a Western approach to knowledge over an Oriental one.[27] Soon after, in 1857, the first three official universities were started in Bombay (Mumbai), Calcutta (Kolkata) and Madras (Chennai). Followed by the University of Punjab in 1882 and the University of Allahabad in 1887. These universities were modeled after the University of London and focused on English and the humanities[29]\n",

            "The British control of the Indian education system continued until the Government of India Act 1935 that transferred more power to provincial politicians and began the \"Indianisation\" of education. This period witnessed a rise in the importance of physical and vocational education as well as the introduction of basic education schemes.[28] When India gained independence in 1947, the nation had a total of 241,369 students registered across 20 universities and 496 colleges. In 1948, the Indian Government established the University Education Commission to oversee the growth and improvement of higher education.[29] In the 1960s and 1970s, the government increased its efforts to support higher education by not only setting up state-funded universities and colleges, but also providing financial assistance to private institutions, resulting in the creation of private aided/ grant-in-aid institutions.[30]\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite the departure of the British, Indian higher education continued to give importance to the languages and humanities until the 1980s. Institutes of professional education like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS), Regional Engineering Colleges (REC) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) were some of the more prominent exceptions to this trend. These institutions drew inspiration from reputed universities in the United States and also received foreign funding. However, the education system remained using colonial English instead of plain English as many ESL countries do under the view that sophistication of language used in education signifies quality of education instead of the quality of structured knowledge that is transferred.[31] Post 1980s, the changing demands of the global economy, lack of foreign investment and political volatility, decreasing value of currency, and an increased strain on government governance capacity, slowed the growth of state-funded higher educational institutions. This led to an increased role of the private sector in the education system.[30]\n",

Through this innovative venture, India's government provides an opportunity to domestic and international students alike in earning a degree certificate through India's National Digital University (NDU), and India's government plans to make India a global leader that can provide affordable and quality higher education. A student who takes 50 percent of courses through a particular stakeholder University (India only), can opt for getting that University's degree certificate or NDU's. However, national and international equivalency of these degree certificate's would be same. Only universities and institutions that meet high standards and deliver quality subjects will be allowed to offer courses or full-fledged programs through the platform. These programs and courses will be audited and certified regularly by academicians and professors of practice for communicability, content structure, and relevance. They will also ensure the course's reliability through ensuring its standalone capability, setting required pass percentage, and required prerequisites for successful engagement. Additionally, they will ensure the return on investment (ROI) each course provides, build suggestive post-requisites based on global trends to make the learning experience inclusive for all kinds of learners. Furthermore, they will construct best scientific practices in content delivery, such as chunking, examining in parts, and using real-world scenarios for case projects, etc. The courses and it's syllabi will be standardized per global standards to ensure global validity. National Digital University is expected to start in July 2023,[clarification needed] and have started requesting program and course proposals from all the Indian college's and universities. The LMS platform is built by support of top educational agencies and industries that are interested in building or already have a corporate academy, and the government plans to integrate virtual assistants with ChatGPT like features to build an interactive learning experience, course related peer learning chatroom's, national and international webinars, mobile optimization of course pages and features, and wide opportunities for stakeholder industries to offer apprenticeship to students that meet their requirements into the platform.[40]\n",

Quality - The quality of programs structure-wise and quality-wise are substandard and lack objectives that can meet the basic industrial requirement of \"skilled-professionals.\" However, the assessment methods employed are taxing and the pacing of the courses (quantity over quality approach) are made forcefully quick under the assumption that these are the essential indicators of 'show' quality (appearance quality). These unscientific strategies and promotion of survival mentality instead of growth mentality leads to unsuccessful learning among students. Streamlining of bachelor's program was brought in the Indian system by following other countries by educators who proved they could give the same quality that a four-year degree could provide with a three-year degree. However, the vision of these resolute educators are lost in time, and sub-standardization and political objectives took over the program structure. For example, when a 21st-century three year Indian bachelor's program is compared with a four-year International bachelor's programs it would be in quality only worth of a two-year college program because usually the first year of these programs are heavily focused on general and arts subjects. When core courses of these programs that cover the same topic are compared, Indian courses lack both leading building blocks of learning content, and the depth and fluidity of international courses. A minimum of 65 - 70 percent mastery threshold that internationally is considered as basic readiness for advancing from foundational to advanced courses is not required in Indian programs. Lack of quality in education resulting from these drawbacks lead students gaining substandard and unclear knowledge which in-turn leads to mass unemployment rates among educated youths of India, and it's primarily due to this learned incompetency or incapacity. [81] As part of the ongoing reformation of the National Education Policy (NEP), the Indian government plans to shift academic curriculums from the perspective of academicians to that of professors with practical industry experience. Additionally, there are plans to introduce four-year degree programs instead of restructuring the existing three-year degrees with the aims to ensure competence and quality while offering students a wider range of options. Furthermore, there are plans to establish accelerated two-year degree programs that meet international standards to address the increasing demand for skilled professionals in specific sectors, and providing curriculum licensing agreements to industry giants, allowing them to hire workers at a young age and provide them with on-the-job education to obtain a respective University education. [82] [83] [84] Bringing four-year degree programs is seen with doubt by the media during a time and period when nations with four-year degree programs are lamenting the sustainability of prolonged educational pathways. Experts opine that in an age marked by the widespread availability of information and the rise of modern technologies, traditional educational structures fails to meet the dynamic demands of the labor market.

Lack of quality in education resulting from these drawbacks lead students gaining substandard and unclear knowledge which in-turn leads to mass unemployment rates among educated youths of India, and it's primarily due to this learned incompetency or incapacity. As part of the ongoing reformation of the National Education Policy (NEP), the Indian government plans to shift academic curriculums from the perspective of academicians to that of professors with practical industry experience. Additionally, there are plans to introduce four-year degree programs instead of restructuring the existing three-year degrees with the aims to ensure competence and quality while offering students a wider range of options. Furthermore, there are plans to establish accelerated two-year degree programs that meet international standards to address the increasing demand for skilled professionals in specific sectors, and providing curriculum licensing agreements to industry giants, allowing them to hire workers at a young age and provide them with on-the-job education to obtain a respective University education. Bringing four-year degree programs is seen with doubt by the media during a time and period when nations with four-year degree programs are lamenting the sustainability of prolonged educational pathways. Experts opine that in an age marked by the widespread availability of information and the rise of modern technologies, traditional educational structures fails to meet the dynamic demands of the labor market. Politics - Higher education is a high stakes issue in India. It is subject to heavy government involvement. Despite the system's lack of state funding, 15.5% of government expenditure goes toward higher education.[87] Also, many prominent political figures either own or sit on the managerial board of the Universities.[88] This leads to the exertion of intense political pressures on the administration of these institutions.[87] Caste based reservations make Indian higher education an even more contested topic. While some make the case that caste-based quotas are necessary to tackle prevailing socio-economic disparities,[89] others see it as exclusionary to upper-caste individuals.[90] The NEP reformation further helps to increase these problems where educators will hold a power to act based on caste and religion based politics in determining who will go further in studies and who should not. This effectively reduces the race for quality education at quality institutions in favor of majority power holders. As a result of biased inclusionism that does not fit for needs of the society as whole and the historic exclusionism of minorities, student activisms are rampant, apart from this political organization of academic staff are widespread to protect their own interests.\n",

which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the centre and the state.', '[2] Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).', '[3]\\n\\nAs per the latest 2011 Census, about 8.15% (98.615 million)[citation needed] of Indians are graduates, with Union Territories of Chandigarh and Delhi topping the list with 24.65% and 22.56% of their population being graduates respectively.', '[4] Indian higher education system has expanded at a fast pace by adding nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students in a decade from 2000–01 to 2010–11.', '[5][2]\\n\\nAs of 2020 , India has over 1000 universities, with a break up of 54 central universities, 416 state universities, 125 deemed universities, 361 state private universities and 159 Institutes of National Importance which include AIIMS, IIMs, IIITs, IISERs, IITs and NITs among others.', '[6][2][7][8][9][10][11] Other institutions include 52,627 colleges as government degree colleges, private colleges, standalone institutes and post-graduate research institutions, functioning under these universities as reported by the MHRD in 2020.', '[12] Colleges may be Autonomous, i.e.', 'empowered to examine their own degrees, up to PhD level in some cases, or non-autonomous, in which case their examinations are under the supervision of the university to which they are affiliated; in either case, however, degrees are awarded in the name of the university rather than the college.', 'The emphasis in the tertiary level of education lies on science and technology.', '[13] Indian educational institutions by 2004 consisted of many technology institutes.', '[14] Distance learning and open education is also a feature of the Indian higher education system, and is looked after by the Distance Education Council.', '[14] Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) is the largest university in the world by number of students, having approximately 3.5 million students across the globe.', '[15][16][17]\\n\\nSome institutions of India, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc),Indian Agricultural Research Institute , Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), Institute of Good Manufacturing Practices India (IGMPI), University of Delhi (DU), University of Calcutta (CU), University of Madras, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have been globally acclaimed for their standard of education.', '[14][18][19][20]\\n\\nIndian higher education is radical in terms of accessibility, and needs radical reforms in standards, giving value, and pacing.', 'A focus on enforcing both streamlining and holding higher standards of curriculum with the help of international academic publishers for transparency and reducing inequalities characterised by globalisation;[21] making the vocational and doctoral education pipeline value-oriented and innovative; personalisation of the sector for students to gain immediate and valid transferable credentials in their own pace (e.g., Massive open online course, digital learning,[22] etc.', '); empowering students to seamlessly transition in and out of both education and the workforce as needed while providing continuous learning experience blocks at each stages of education opportunities for equipping the individuals with essential knowledge building blocks for comprehensive understanding of the skill providing courses; establishing a robust institutional accountability in service delivery and addressing related complexities; collaborating with international standardization agencies to ensure that students receive global recognition for their educational certificates, for guaranteeing employers that the educational content aligns with what esteemed universities worldwide employ, etc.', 'are fundamental changes that are critical in attaining both international and national competency.', '[23] The rise of interest in the IT sector and engineering education in India has confined students to cramming knowledge, providing them with fewer opportunities to explore and develop their passions with modern educational elements like cooperative education and work-based training.', 'Furthermore, by the end of the four-year degree, much of what students study in the initial years becomes irrelevant or subject to knowledge erosion.', 'Many foreign countries view the traditional degree pathway, which compels students of working age to halt their careers for half a decade to earn a degree in a digitized academic environment, as less effective and unsuitable for a growing economy.', '[24] Especially in a world where 40% of the global population was connected to the Internet in 2015 through 25 billion devices, and where in STEM fields, \"micro-certificates\" are a required aspect of lifelong learning to stay relevant; many of these micro-certificates or learning blocks either function as a start of a base of knowledge or add on to an existing base.', 'For example, most programming courses only take 3 months to learn in an academic setting and that too along with other subjects, and are the only requirement of base knowledge for springboard programming related tech jobs.', 'Jim Heckman, a Nobel laureate and professor of economics at the University of Chicago, asserts that education should be encapsulated by the \"6Cs\" - critical thinking, content communication, collaboration, creativity, character, and citizenship.', \"To broaden students' worldviews and instill values such as creativity, character, and citizenship, India needs to focus on introducing elective pathways to liberal arts education.\", 'This will facilitate the development of personal management skills, passions, creativity, and foster natural and concerted personal growth.', '[25]\\n\\nHistory [ edit ]\\n\\nIndia is believed to have had a system of higher education as early as 1000 B.C.', '[26] Unlike present day universities, these ancient learning centers were primarily concerned with dispersing Vedic education.', '[27] The modern Indian education system finds its roots in colonial legacy.', '[28] British colonists used the university system as a tool of cultural colonization.', '[26] Colonial efforts in higher education were carried out initially through the East India Company, followed by the British parliament and later under direct British rule.', '[27] The first institution of higher learning set up by the British East India Company was the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781.', 'This was followed by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784, Benaras Sanskrit College in 1791 and Fort William College in 1800.', '[28][27] With the Charter Act of 1813, the British Parliament officially declared Indian education as one of the duties of the state.', '[28] The same act also removed restrictions on missionary work in British India, thus leading to the establishment of the evangelist Serampore College in 1818.', \"[27] Thomas Babbington Macaulay's famously controversial Minute on Education (1835) reflected the growing support of a Western approach to knowledge over an Oriental one.\", '[27] Soon after, in 1857, the first three official universities were started in Bombay (Mumbai), Calcutta (Kolkata) and Madras (Chennai).', 'Followed by the University of Punjab in 1882 and the University of Allahabad in 1887.', 'These universities were modeled after the University of London and focused on English and the humanities[29]\\n\\nThe British control of the Indian education system continued until the Government of India Act 1935 that transferred more power to provincial politicians and began the \"Indianisation\" of education.', 'This period witnessed a rise in the importance of physical and vocational education as well as the introduction of basic education schemes.', '[28] When India gained independence in 1947, the nation had a total of 241,369 students registered across 20 universities and 496 colleges.', 'In 1948, the Indian Government established the University Education Commission to oversee the growth and improvement of higher education.', '[29] In the 1960s and 1970s, the government increased its efforts to support higher education by not only setting up state-funded universities and colleges, but also providing financial assistance to private institutions, resulting in the creation of private aided/ grant-in-aid institutions.', '[30]\\n\\nDespite the departure of the British, Indian higher education continued to give importance to the languages and humanities until the 1980s.', 'Institutes of professional education like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS), Regional Engineering Colleges (REC) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) were some of the more prominent exceptions to this trend.', 'These institutions drew inspiration from reputed universities in the United States and also received foreign funding.', 'However, the education system remained using colonial English instead of plain English as many ESL countries do under the view that sophistication of language used in education signifies quality of education instead of the quality of structured knowledge that is transferred.', '[31] Post 1980s, the changing demands of the global economy, lack of foreign investment and political volatility, decreasing value of currency, and an increased strain on government governance capacity, slowed the growth of state-funded higher educational institutions.', 'This led to an increased role of the private sector in the education system.', '[30]\\n\\nUniversities [ edit ]\\n\\nUniversities in India have evolved in divergent streams with each stream monitored by an apex body, indirectly controlled by the Ministry of Education and funded jointly by the state governments.', 'Most universities are administered by the States, however, there are 18 important universities called Central Universities, which are maintained by the Union Government.', 'The increased funding of the central universities give them an advantage over their state competitors.', 'The University Grants Commission estimated that in 2013–14, 22,849 PhDs and 20,425 MPhil degrees were awarded.', 'Over half of these were in the fields of Science, Engineering/Technology, Medicine and Agriculture.', 'As of 2014 –15, over 178,000 students were enrolled in research programs.', '[32]\\n\\nApart from the several hundred state universities, there is a network of research institutions that provide opportunities for advanced learning and research leading up to a PhD in branches of science, technology and agriculture.', 'Several have won international recognition.', 'Twenty-five of these institutions come under the umbrella of the CSIR – Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and over 60 fall under the ICAR – Indian Council of Agricultural Research.', 'In addition, the DAE – Department of Atomic Energy, and other ministries support various research laboratories.', 'The National Institute of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are among the most prestigious institutions within the technology sciences.The Indian Agricultural Research Institute is one of the best in the country for agricultural education.', 'Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research[33](IISERs) are the premier research institutes in the field of science education and research.', 'There are several thousand colleges (affiliated to different universities) that provide undergraduate science, agriculture, commerce and humanities courses in India.', 'Amongst these, the best also offer post graduate courses while some also offer facilities for research and PhD studies.', 'Technical education has grown rapidly in recent years.', 'Of 27.3 million students enrolled in undergraduate studies, about 4.5 million are in engineering fields.', '[6] With recent capacity additions, it is now estimated that to graduate over 500,000 engineers (with 4-yr undergraduate degrees) annually, and there is also a corresponding increase in the graduation of computer scientists (roughly 50,000 with post-graduate degree).', 'In addition, the nation graduates over 1.2 million scientists.', 'Furthermore, each year, the nation is enrolling at least 350,000 in its engineering diploma programs (with plans to increase this by about 50,000).', \"Thus, India's annual enrollment of scientists, engineers and technicians now exceeds 2 million.\", 'Across the country, tertiary enrollment rates have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 3.5% in the 5 years preceding 2016.', 'Current enrollment stands at 34.58 million, over 15% more than the 29.2 million enrolled in 2011.', \"[6]\\n\\nInternational league tables produced in 2006 by the London-based Times Higher Education Supplement(THES) confirmed Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)'s place among the world's top 200 universities.\", \"[34] Likewise, THES 2006 ranked JNU's School of Social Sciences[35] at the 57th position among the world's top 100 institutes for social sciences.\", 'In 2017, THES ranked the Indian Institute of Science as the eighth best \"small university\" in the world.', 'A small university was defined as one with less than 5000 students.', 'In 2015, the institute also became the first Indian institute to make it to the top hundred in the THES list of engineering institutes.', 'It was ranked 99.', '[36]\\n\\nThe University of Calcutta was the first multi-disciplinary university of modern India.', \"According to The Times Higher Education Supplement's survey of the world's top arts and humanities universities, dated 10 November 2005, this university, ranked 39, was the only Indian university to make it to the top 50 list in that year.\", 'Other research institutes are the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, the Asiatic Society, and the Indian Statistical Institute.', 'The National Law School of India University is highly regarded, with some of its students being awarded Rhodes Scholarships to Oxford University, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi is consistently rated the top medical school in the country.', '[37] Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are the top management institutes in India.', '[38]\\n\\nThe private sector is strong in Indian higher education.', 'This has been partly as a result of the decision by the Government to divert spending to the goal of universalisation of elementary education.', 'Within a decade different state assemblies have passed bills for privately funded institutions, including Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Shiv Nadar University, Xavier Labour Relations Institute, O. P. Jindal Global University, Ashoka University and many more.', 'India is a leading source of international students around the world.', 'More than 200,000 Indian students are studying abroad.', \"They are likely to be enrolled in master's programs that provide them opportunities to enhance their career potential.\", '[39]\\n\\nFollowing changes of recent times in education, India through its NEP 2020 project plans to provide cost-effective access to higher education (post-secondary) to everyone interested through National Digital University, an Online University that works by hub-and-spoke model.', \"Through this innovative venture, India's government provides an opportunity to domestic and international students alike in earning a degree certificate through India's National Digital University (NDU), and India's government plans to make India a global leader that can provide affordable and quality higher education.\", \"A student who takes 50 percent of courses through a particular stakeholder University (India only), can opt for getting that University's degree certificate or NDU's.\", \"However, national and international equivalency of these degree certificate's would be same.\", 'Only universities and institutions that meet high standards and deliver quality subjects will be allowed to offer courses or full-fledged programs through the platform.', 'These programs and courses will be audited and certified regularly by academicians and professors of practice for communicability, content structure, and relevance.', \"They will also ensure the course's reliability through ensuring its standalone capability, setting required pass percentage, and required prerequisites for successful engagement.\", 'Additionally, they will ensure the return on investment (ROI) each course provides, build suggestive post-requisites based on global trends to make the learning experience inclusive for all kinds of learners.', 'Furthermore, they will construct best scientific practices in content delivery, such as chunking, examining in parts, and using real-world scenarios for case projects, etc.', \"The courses and it's syllabi will be standardized per global standards to ensure global validity.\", \"National Digital University is expected to start in July 2023,[clarification needed] and have started requesting program and course proposals from all the Indian college's and universities.\", \"The LMS platform is built by support of top educational agencies and industries that are interested in building or already have a corporate academy, and the government plans to integrate virtual assistants with ChatGPT like features to build an interactive learning experience, course related peer learning chatroom's, national and international webinars, mobile optimization of course pages and features, and wide opportunities for stakeholder industries to offer apprenticeship to students that meet their requirements into the platform.\", '[40]\\n\\nPost-secondary education stages [ edit ]\\n\\nThe new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the central government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India.', \"The policy approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.\", '[41] The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education.', 'The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India.', \"The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.\", '[42]\\n\\nShortly after the release of the policy, the government clarified that no one will be forced to study any particular language and that the medium of instruction will not be shifted from English to any regional language.', '[43] The language policy in NEP is a broad guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the implementation.', '[44] Education in India is a Concurrent List subject.', \"[45]\\n\\nNEP's higher education policy proposes a 4-year multi-disciplinary bachelor's degree in
